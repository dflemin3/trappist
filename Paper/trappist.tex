%% ABSTRACT %%

\begin{abstract}

Abstract.

- we constrain the stellar evolution and mass of TRAPPIST-1 using best priors and constraints currently available. we make our posterior distributions available for use with water loss simulations as the FXUV is a core input to such models, be it energy limited or recombination limited, maybe non-thermal escape models as well (look into that). our model and machine learning approach is all open source and documented on github, including a repo for the project itself
- TRAPPIST-1 conference stellar evolution stuff is 1st day, so email invited talks presenters and send them draft and thank them for their work which I use and cite in my own work - adam burgasser and jeff linsky
- 5 plots/tables: table of priors; corner plot; L, LXUV, R sampled from posteriors; \approxposterior comparison plot with distributions on top of each other 
- from Peacock+2018: "Late-type M stars remain UV active for much longer than their early M counterparts, typically with more variability in the FUV than the NUV (Miles Shkolnik 2017)."

%% Intro %%

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

\citet{Reiners2014} find that rotation period can determine Lx
\citet{Newton2017} find that LHalpha, an activity indicator saturates as low Prot/Ro with the cutoff occuring at a similar Ro to other inidicators like Lx

For low-mass stars in the saturated phase, $L_{X}$ remains a constant fraction of $L_{bol}$ and is observed to cluster around $\log_{10}(L_X/L_{bol}) \approx -3$ \citep{Pizzolato2003,Wright2011,Wright2018}. 

"Although the dynamo processes that drive stellar activity and XUV emission in fully-convective stars have been shown to evolve qualitatively similar to solar-type stars \citep{Wright2016,Wright2018} ..."

- define XUV, what it is, and why it's important

Introduction about stellar activity for late type stars, what it is like and how late type stars evolve, and finally why it matters for exoplanet habitability, e.g. the XUV flux is a critical parameter for atmospheric escape and water loss, other loss mechanisms scale as FXUV to some power, like energy-limited and recombination-limited escape. In the intro, I explain what saturated and unsaturated phases correspond to physically, and under what conditions they are expected to occur. Argue how this qualitative behavior is observed for both partially and fully-convective stars, e.g. FGK and M dwarfs.

This study is critical and timely since people are modeling the hell out of TRAPPIST-1 and its planets and JWST proposals are going in to observe this system. My approach is generic and applicable to any systems with data and is relevant for LUVOIR where it can observe a statistically meaningful sample of planets, need \approxposterior for speed for constraints

The saturation ratio shows tentative evidence of increasing with decreasing stellar mass \citep{Wright2011,Jackson2012}, consistent with the observation that later type low-mass stars are more active \citep[e.g.][]{West2008}. 

\section{Model} \label{sec:model}

We simulate TRAPPIST-1's evolution using the \stellar module in \vplanet \citep{Barnes2016,vplanet2018} that performs a bicubic interpolation over mass and age of the \citet{Baraffe2015} stellar evolution tracks. The \citet{Baraffe2015} models, also employed by both \citet{Burgasser2017} and \citet{vanGrootel2018} to constrain TRAPPIST-1's stellar properties, were computed for solar metallicity stars and hence are suitable for TRAPPIST-1 whose [Fe/H] is consistent with solar \citep{Gillon2016}, although \citet{Burgasser2017} argue TRAPPIST-1 has a slightly super-solar metallicity based on isochrone modeling.

The X-ray luminosity, L$_{X}$, evolution of fully convective stars follows the same broken power law model examined for partially-convective FGK stars \citep{Wright2016,Wright2018}. We assume TRAPPIST-1's L$_{XUV}$ evolution traces that of L$_{X}$ and simulate the $L_{XUV}$ evolution using the broken power law model of \citet{Pizzolato2003} and \citet{Ribas2005} implemented in \stellar as
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:lxuv}
\frac{L_\mathrm{XUV}}{L_\mathrm{bol}} = \left\{
				\begin{array}{lcr}
					f_\mathrm{sat} &\ & t \leq t_\mathrm{sat} \\
					f_\mathrm{sat}\left(\frac{t}{t_\mathrm{sat}}\right)^{-\beta_\mathrm{XUV}} &\ & t > t_\mathrm{sat}
				\end{array}
				\right.
\end{align}
where $f_{sat}$ is the constant ratio of stellar XUV to bolometric luminosity during the saturated phase, $t_{sat}$ is the duration of the saturated phase, and $\beta_{XUV}$ is the exponent that controls how steeply L$_{XUV}$ decays after saturation.

%% MCMC %%

\section{Markov Chain Monte Carlo} \label{sec:mcmc}

We use \texttt{emcee} \citep{ForemanMackey2013}, a Python implementation of the \citet{Goodman2010} affine-invariant Metropolis-Hastings Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm, to infer posterior probability distributions for our model parameters. These parameters comprise the state vector
\begin{equation}
    \textbf{x} = \{m_{\star}, f_{sat}, t_{sat}, \mathrm{age}, \beta_{XUV}\},
\end{equation}
where $m_{\star}$ and age are the stellar mass and age, respectively, and the other parameters are defined by Eqn.~\ref{eqn:lxuv}.  MCMC sampling allows us to derive probability distributions for our model parameters that are conditioned on observations and our understanding on the underlying physics while accounting for correlations between parameters and their observational uncertainties.  

Note that our method to derive probabilistic constraints for TRAPPIST-1's stellar and XUV evolution is applicable to any low-mass star with measured $L_{bol}$ and $L_{XUV}$ for use with studies examining the water loss history of exoplanets or their evolving space weather environment (XXX cite). Additional constraints for individual systems, e.g. age estimates, improve both the accuracy and precision of the derived probabilistic constraints.  

\subsection{Priors} \label{sec:mcmc:priors}

With only two data points to condition our analysis, $L_{bol}$ and $L_{XUV}$, our prior probability distributions will strongly impact our results. We leverage observations of TRAPPIST-1 and late M dwarfs to assemble the best available empirical constraints to serve as priors for our MCMC analysis of TRAPPIST-1 and that are applicable to any fully-convective M dwarfs. We summarize our adopted distributions in Table~\ref{tab:priors}.

Following \citet{vanGrootel2018}, we rely on TRAPPIST-1's luminosity (here in our likelihood function, Eqn.~\ref{eqn:lnlike}) and age to constrain its mass and therefore adopt a flat prior of $m_{\star} \sim \mathcal{U}(0.07, 0.11)$. We use the empirical age constraint for TRAPPIST-1 derived by \citet{Burgasser2017}, age $\sim \mathcal{N}(7.6, 2.2^2)$ Gyr, as their thorough analysis considered both observations of TRAPPIST-1 and a host of empirical age indicators for ultracool dwarfs. 

We construct an empirical $f_{sat} = \log_{10}(L_{XUV}/L_{bol})$ distribution for late M dwarfs from the sample of fully-convective, saturated stars with observed $L_{X}$ from \citet{Wright2011}. For each star in the \citet{Wright2011} sample, we follow \citet{Wheatley2017} and estimate $L_{XUV}$ as a function of L$_{X}$ using Eqn.~(2) from \citet{Chadney2015}. We find that the distribution of $f_{sat}$ for fully-convective, saturated M dwarfs is well-approximated by a normal distribution, $f_{sat} \sim \mathcal{N}(-2.92, 0.26^2)$, and we adopt it as our prior. 

The duration of the saturated phase is estimated to be $t_{sat} \approx 100$ Myr for FGK stars \citep{Jackson2012}. Studies of stellar activity of late type stars as a function of stellar age, or its proxy, rotation period, indicate that the activity lifetime, and hence duration of the saturated phase, is likely longer for later-type stars \citep{Shkolnik2014,Wright2011,West2015,GonzalezAlvarez2019}, with fully-convective M dwarfs potentially remaining active for Gyrs, up to the ages of field stars \citep{West2008,Schneider2018}. TRAPPIST-1's high observed L$_{X}$ \citep{Wheatley2017}, short photometric rotation period \citep[3.3 d, ][]{Luger2017}, and low Rossby number \citep[Ro $\approx 0.01$, ][]{Roettenbacher2017,Wright2018} suggest that TRAPPIST-1 is still saturated today \citep{Pizzolato2003,Wright2011,Wright2018,Garraffo2017,GonzalezAlvarez2019}. Both \citet{Roettenbacher2017} and \citet{Morris2018} suggest that the photometrically-determined rotation period is inaccurate, with the latter study proposing that the 3.3 d period corresponds to a characteristic timescale for active regions on the stellar surface, but TRAPPIST-1's $v \sin i = 6$ km s$^{-1}$ \citep{Barnes2014} implies a rotation period of $\approx 1$ d for $i = 90^{\circ}$, providing evidence that TRAPPIST-1's rapid rotation is physical and consistent with saturation.  Given these constraints, we adopt a broad uniform $t_{sat}$ prior distribution over $0.1 - 12$ Gyr.

Finally, in the unsaturated phase, L$_{X}$, and hence $L_{XUV}$, fall off exponentially with powerlaw slope $\beta_{XUV}$ \citep{Ribas2005}. \citet{Jackson2012} find that $\beta_{XUV}$ does not vary significantly with stellar mass in their sample of FGK stars, and \citet{Wright2016} found that the X-ray evolution of fully-convective stars is qualitatively similar to that of partially-convective FGK stars. Therefore, we adopt the distribution derived from the \citet{Jackson2012} sample of late K dwarfs as our prior: $\beta_{XUV} \sim \mathcal{N}(-1.18, 0.31^2)$.

\subsection{Likelihood Function and Convergence}

We condition our analysis on the observed the bolometric luminosity, $L_{bol} = 5.22 \pm{0.19} \times 10^{-4} \ L_{\odot}$ \citep{vanGrootel2018} and XUV luminosity, $L_{XUV} = 3.9 \pm{0.5} \times 10^{-7} \ L_{\odot}$ \citep{Wheatley2017}. We computed $L_{XUV}$ by convolving the \citet{vanGrootel2018} $L_{bol}$ measurement and its uncertainty with the $L_{XUV}/L_{bol}$ constraints from \citet{Wheatley2017}.

For a given state vector \textbf{x}, we define our loglikelihood function as
\small
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:lnlike}
\begin{split}
    \ln \mathcal{L} \propto & -\frac{1}{2} \left[ \frac{(L_{bol} - L_{bol}(\textbf{x}))^2}{\sigma_{L_{bol}}^2} + \frac{(L_{XUV} - L_{XUV}(\textbf{x}))^2}{\sigma_{L_{XUV}}^2} \right] \\
    & + \ln \mathrm{Prior}(\textbf{x}) + C
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\normalsize
where $L_{bol}$, $L_{XUV}$ and $L_{bol}(\textbf{x})$, $L_{XUV}(\textbf{x})$ are the observed values and \vplanet outputs given \textbf{x}, respectively, $\sigma_{L_{bol}}$ and $\sigma_{L_{XUV}}$ are the observational uncertainties, $\ln \mathrm{Prior}(\textbf{x})$ is the prior probability, and $C$ is an arbitrary constant. 

With our likelihood function and priors specified, we run our MCMC analysis with 100 parallel chains for 10,000 iterations, initializing each chain by randomly sampling each element of \textbf{x} from their respective prior distributions. Each step of the MCMC chain, \vplanet takes \textbf{x} as input and simulates TRAPPIST-1's evolution up to its age, predicting $L_{bol}$ and $L_{XUV}$ to evaluate the likelihood function. We discard the first 500 iterations as burn-in and assess the convergence of our MCMC chains by computing the integrated autocorrelation length and acceptance fraction for each chain. We find a mean acceptance fraction of 0.45 and a minimum and mean number of iterations per integrated autocorrelation length of 75 and 110, respectively, indicating that our chains have likely converged.

\section{Results} \label{sec:results}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:corner}, we display the posterior probability distributions for our model parameters derived by our MCMC analysis, adopting the median values of the marginal distributions as our best-fit solutions and the 16th and 84th percentiles as the upper and lower uncertainties. Since we rely on ...

   \caption{Joint and marginal posterior probability distributions for the TRAPPIST-1 stellar parameters made using \texttt{corner} \citep{ForemanMackey2016}. From the posterior distribution, we infer that there is a $42.6\%$ chance that TRAPPIST-1 is still in the saturated phase today, i.e. P$(t_{sat} \geq \mathrm{ age } | \mathrm{data}) \approx 0.426$ , and that there is only a $0.4\%$ chance that $t_{sat} \leq 1$ Gyr.}%
    \label{fig:corner}%
\end{figure*}

\subsection{TRAPPIST-1's Evolutionary History}

Here we consider plausible stellar evolutionary histories for TRAPPIST-1, conditioned on observations, by evolving 100 draws from the posterior distribution using \vplanet. We plot the evolution of TRAPPIST-1's $L_{bol}$, $L_{XUV}$, and radius in Fig.~\ref{fig:evol} and compare our models to the measured values. 

\begin{figure*}[t]
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../Analysis/Evol/trappist1Evol.pdf}
   \caption{Plausible evolutionary histories of TRAPPIST-1's bolometric luminosity (left), XUV luminosity (center), and radius (right) using 100 samples drawn from the posterior distribution and simulated with \vplanet. In each panel, the blue shaded regions display the 1, 2, and 3 $\sigma$ the observational uncertainties. The insets display the marginalized distributions of the quantities displayed in each panel evaluated at the age of the system, with the black dashed lines indicating the observed value and +/- 1 $\sigma$ uncertainty. The radius and bolometric luminosity constraints are adopted from \citet{vanGrootel2018}, and the L$_{XUV}$ constraint is taken from \citet{Wheatley2017}.}%
    \label{fig:evol}%
\end{figure*}

Since TRAPPIST-1 is likely still saturated today, its $L_{XUV}$ evolution tracks $L_{bol}$. Both decrease by a factor of ${\sim}40$ along the pre-main sequence for ${\sim}1$ Gyr before stabilizing on the main sequence, with some $L_{XUV}$ evolutions entering the unsaturated powerlaw decay at late times near the age of the system. We find posterior values of $L_{bol} = 5.22 \pm{0.19} \times 10^{-4} \ L_{\odot}$ and $L_{XUV} = 3.9 \pm{0.5} \times 10^{-7} \ L_{\odot}$ that both match their observed values by construction via our likelihood function, Eqn~\ref{eqn:lnlike}. TRAPPIST-1's radius likely shrank by roughly a factor of 4 along the pre-main sequence, with our posterior present-day radius $R_{\star} = 0.11 \pm{0.0007} \ R_{\odot}$. Our posterior radius is ${\sim} 8\%$ smaller than the \citet{vanGrootel2018} constraint, $R_{\star} = 0.121 \pm {0.003} \ R_{\odot}$, that was computed from their inferred mass and TRAPPIST-1's density \citep{Delrez2018}. This difference arises from the likely underprediction of TRAPPIST-1's radius by the \citet{Baraffe2015} models, consistent with stellar evolution models often underestimating the radii of late M dwarfs \citep{Reid2005,Spada2013,Jackson2019}, and suggests that TRAPPIST-1 might have super-solar metallicity \citep{Burgasser2017,vanGrootel2018}. If we instead follow \citet{vanGrootel2018} and compute the radius from our marginalized stellar mass posterior distribution and the \citet{Delrez2018} density constraint, we obtain $R_{\star} = 0.12 \pm{0.002} \ R_{\odot}$, in agreement with the \citet{vanGrootel2018} constraint.
